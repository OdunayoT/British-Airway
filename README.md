# British Airway Analysis

Introduction

British Airways has recognized its customer dissatisfaction and aims to identify common issues its customer experience while using its service to improve service quality and enhance customer experience.


Methodology

The dataset has 7 fields namely; reviews, date, country, seat type, recommended, departure destination, arrival destination, and type of traveler. After I imported the data into Power Query in Excel, I scrubbed the long form review and ensured that they only fell into two categories (Trip Verified and Not Verified), I formatted the date and star rating column that was recognized as text to number, I replaced the data in the recommended column to proper case, and I split the record in the route column to arrival and departure destination. The abbreviated records were replaced with the actual country code for easy readability.
