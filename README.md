Methodology

After I imported the data into Power Query in Excel, I scrubbed the long form review and ensured that they only fell into two categories (Trip Verified and Not Verified), I formatted the date and star rating column that was recognized as text to number, I replaced the data in the recommended column to proper case, and I splitted the record in the route column to arrival and departure destination. The abbreviated records were replaced with the actual country code for easy readability.
